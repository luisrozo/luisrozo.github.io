## Hard skills

After studying Software Engineering, I have knowledge about lots of terms related to it,
such as anything related to **agile ecosystem** or testing everywhere. Also, I
consirder myself as a problem-solving professional.

As for languages, I speak Spanish natively, but I have a B2 level in
English (however, I want to improve it).

I know the most the following programming languages:

* **Java** (70%): used in almost every project. Spring forever!
* **JavaScript** (60%): used in my final degree project, and in some projects at Intelygenz
* **PHP** (50%): some (university and real-world) projects developed using it
* **Python** (40%): used in some internships projects

Also worked with SQL and noSQL (Mongo) databases!

I love taking courses in order to know about more and different technologies.
In fact, recently, I have taken lessons about NodeJS and Cucumber frameworks.

## Soft skills

I am an enthusiastic of working in team! Great teammates and a good connection between them
define the success of a project. I think everyone learn from each other.

In addition, I am a persistent and flexible professional. I work hard in what's necessary and
I think I can deal with any new challenge in front of me.
