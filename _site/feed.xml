I’ve decided enough with the ceremony, I should just dive in. But do consider yourself welcome to my humble blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve zoomed through the Grow with Google Challenge Scholarship on Udacity, probably faster than I should have. We’re allowed three months, and I finished in less than a week since I have so much time on my hands. Still, if I hope to be selected for the next step, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.udacity.com/course/mobile-web-specialist-nanodegree--nd024&quot;&gt;Mobile Web Specialist scholarship&lt;/a&gt;, I need to stay active on the forums and help other people out. This will be a good way for me to review the material, so it sounds like a plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned how to make an app offline-first using service workers. This helps mobile users a lot because some content will load (maybe old content, but still) in low or no connection areas. No more “lie-fi”!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the course was about all the new features in ES6. I’ve been a fan for as long as I’ve worked with JavaScript, since I started after ES6 was released. Strangely, I got a bit frustrated with the new object method definition shorthand. The old way:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;myObj = {
  name: &quot;foo&quot;,
  hairColor: &quot;brown&quot;,
  someMethod: function() {
    // method code here;
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;can now be written like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;myObj = {
  name: &quot;foo&quot;,
  hairColor: &quot;brown&quot;,
  someMethod() {
    // method code here;
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see that it’s shorter, which might make it better, and I’ve &lt;a href=&quot;https://ariya.io/2013/03/es6-and-method-definitions&quot;&gt;read&lt;/a&gt; that it brings method definitions more in line with how &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;get() { ... }&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;set() { ... }&lt;/code&gt; are defined in ES5, which are both fair points. But I’m used to reading JavaScript objects as key-value pairs, and part of me misses the colon. What’s more, given the new kind of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/this%20%26%20object%20prototypes/ch2.md#lexical-this&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;this&lt;/code&gt;-scoping&lt;/a&gt; we see in arrow functions (also ES6), I have some trouble processing a strange third thing that uses neither the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;function&lt;/code&gt; keyword nor the arrow &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Even now, I’m not sure I can say confidently how &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; would work inside a method defined the new way. I’m sure I will one day.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris</name></author><summary type="html">I thought of starting with “Welcome to my first blog post!” because that’s how I started the last three times, with some variation.
