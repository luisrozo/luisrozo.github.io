I am a Software Engineer!

I was born in **Cádiz**, which is probably the most breathtaking city around the world. I have studied Computer Science at _Universidad de Cádiz_. Nowadays, I am learning at [Intelygenz](https://intelygenz.com/), a Software Solutions Development company located in Madrid, Spain. Take a look around this website to know a bit more about me!
