In my case, during the third year of my Computer Science degree, I was focused on this project, which I’m going to explain for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/myproject_tkstats.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Terminkalender&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is a project driven by Universidad de Cádiz. As a final project of his degree, the student Javier Osuna &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/javosuher/Terminkalender&quot;&gt;developed a libGDX app&lt;/a&gt; which runs on PC as well as Android mobile phones. This app has an educational purpose: it would be used by students of Universidad de Cádiz &lt;strong&gt;German&lt;/strong&gt; subject. They would have to use the &lt;em&gt;in-app&lt;/em&gt; chat to meet other classmates, agreeing what, when and who to do with, trying to write on German applying language techniques learnt through subject temary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/my_projects_tk.png&quot; alt=&quot;Terminkalender screenshot with some activities&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;i&gt;Terminkalender screenshot with some activities&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My contribution to this project was based on, in addition to implement some features to the app, making a deep data analysis of what students talked about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to develop a Python script, which does the following tasks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Preprocess the entire logs produced by the application: due to the fact that we’re talking about a chating app, extracting conclusions of how students use German language is a pretty difficult task; so try to unify the most of the chats was mandatory (such as simplify all &lt;em&gt;laughts&lt;/em&gt; - I mean haha, jajjaja, jaajaja, jejjeje, hihihi… - to “jajaja” in order to count how many times students had fun).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Keep track of more than 20 different metrics from three different perspectives: globally, per student and per student pair.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Produce an output which reflects every single metric.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, there was a paper version of the app, making interesting to compare the results between app and paper. Paper chats was reflected in Excel files, so I had to adapt the script to read the same information but through a spreadsheet instead of a &lt;em&gt;log.txt&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to this, the Universidad de Cádiz IT Deparment could make an study about the impact of the application in students, proving that this initiative helps students to learn German.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I developed a decentralized application (or dApp) based on &lt;strong&gt;blockchain&lt;/strong&gt;, especially using Ethereum ecosystem. Other technologies were used too, such as ReactJS, IPFS, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/myproject_eth1.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin: auto; max-width:80%; height:auto; &quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;general-information&quot;&gt;General information&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project aims to prove that, using modern technologies, the problematic of personal data can be solved in any ambit. However, this project is focused on medical paradigmatic case. Users can validate their own medical data, in order to be sold through the platform. Others users will be able to buy (using &lt;em&gt;Ether&lt;/em&gt; as coin) batches (known in the platform as &lt;em&gt;offers&lt;/em&gt;) of users registers in order to gain access to that information. This batches are created by the custodian entity (which could be a hospital in a real world situation). Each purchase will create a block in the blockchain, registring all activity in the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;storing-information-on-chain--off-chain&quot;&gt;Storing information: on-chain &amp;amp; off-chain&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all information is stored on the blockchain (this would be extremly non-viable as explained later). This project uses the InterPlanetary File System, aka IPFS, to store the rest of information in a decentralized way (too).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/myproject_eth2.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin: auto; max-width:80%; height:auto; &quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s some files in the offer creation process which are stored on IPFS. We only store in the blockchain the final IPFS hash, which links to the rest of this files chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-ipfs&quot;&gt;Why IPFS?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s make some estimate, bearing in mind that storing 8 bytes has a cost of 20,000 gas; having each gas an equivalent of 4 gwei.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A 8 bytes transaction for 20,000 gas x 4 gwei/gas =&amp;gt; 8 bytes would cost 80,000 gwei.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;So, talking about kB instead of B, it would cost 10,000,000 of gwei (or ,01 Ether).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;,01 ETH/kB x 1,000 kB =&amp;gt; 10 ETH para almacenar 1 Mb.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Nowdays, an Ether is aprox. €164, so storing 1 Mb of information in a blockchain would cost €1,640.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all this information, we can see clearly that, storing 1 GB of information (a very little amount nowadays) in a blockchain would cost &lt;strong&gt;€1,640,000&lt;/strong&gt;!! (OMG). So, blockchain and IPFS are a very common couple in this ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
